Our code is divided in 5 notebooks:

- `data-cleaning.ipynb`: This notebook written by Dario is doing so cleaning on the data file.
- `3.1-regional_sales.ipynb`: This notebook written by Dario contains the experiments on the sales per region.
- `3.2-number_of_games.ipynb`: This notebook written by Chiara contains the experiments on the number of games per year.
- `3.3-regional_relative_sales_per_genre.ipynb`: This notebook written by Maria contains the experiments on the relative sales per genre (per region).
- `3.4-regional_sales_per_platform.ipynb`: This notebook written by Bertrand contains the experiments on the sales per platform / brands (per region).

The data files is store in the `data/` folder:

- `Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv`: original file of the data
- `games_sales_clean.csv`: file generated by the `data-cleaning.ipynb` notebook and use by the other notebooks.
